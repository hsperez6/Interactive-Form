Interactive Form 

In this interactive form, elements change dynamically depending on user interaction. The form is written with an emphasis on user accessibility, making sure user can navigate the form easily and visibly, and displays error messages when necessary in the required input fields. 

In this form, the first two input fields (name and email) are validated instantly, when user removes focus from the field, to inform the user if the information is valid or not. 

In the email field, if the input fails to pass validation, one of two possible error messages may display. If the email input field is left blank, a 'Email address is required' error message will display. If the email input is not blank, but the information is not in an email format, a 'Email address must be formatted correctly' error message will display.

Both the "Job Role" dropdown menu, and the "Design" dropdown menu affect what is displayed on the form. If the "Other" option is selected in the "Job Role" dropdown menu, a "Other job role?" input field will display. The selected option in the "Design" dropdown menu will decide which options are available in the "Color" dropdown menu.

In the "Register for Activities" section, the "Total: $" will update according to the events the user clicks and signs up for. Furthermore, selecting certain workshops will disable the selectability of other workshops that have conflicting schedules. Therefore, the user will only be able to select one of the conflicting workshops.

In the "Payment" section, the credit-card option is the default selection, and the appropriate inputs are displayed. As the user changes the payment selection, the inputs displayed on the page changes.

Finally, when the user clicks on the submit button, every input on the form is checked using the appropriate validation function to ensure that the information submitted by the user is correct. If any required field does not pass validation, an error message will display, and the section's styling will change to red.
